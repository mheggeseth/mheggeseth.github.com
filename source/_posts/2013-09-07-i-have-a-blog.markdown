Somebody: "Hey, look over there! It's a blog!"  
Everybody: "Oooohhhhh!"

So to get started, I first went to the font of blogging wisdom, Scott Hanselman, and found this post ([Your Blog is the Engine of Community](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx)) which made me feel kind of like this:

#### A Little About Me

I've been a software developer for 9 years and have been doing web development for 7 years. I know some things, but I don't know a lot of things. I'm interested in ASP.NET, JavaScript frameworks (especially [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org))
