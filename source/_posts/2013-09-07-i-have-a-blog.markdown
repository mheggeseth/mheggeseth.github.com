Somebody: "Hey, look over there. It's a blog."  
Everybody: "Oooohhhhh!"  
Somebody (maybe somebody else): "A developer blog!"  
Everybody (again): "Wooowwwww!"

Notwithstanding the widespread, public fanfare that accompanies the debut of a developer blog, It's my first day and I really don't know what I'm doing here. So to get started I went to the font of blogging wisdom, Scott Hanselman, and found ["Your Blog is the Engine of Community"](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx) which made me feel like

Then I found ["Personal Branding for Software Developers"](http://kencenerelli.wordpress.com/2012/03/20/personal-branding-for-software-developers/) and it made me feel a little like

Building my personal brand? Maybe. I did make a sweet logo in Paint.NET and brought in some snazzy web fonts. *Incidentally, [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) is a great way to waste several hours.* Let's stick with the hippy-dippy, free-love blogging advertized by Mr. Hanselman.

My goals for this blog are these:

* **Be helpful.** While I want this blog to be a container for my passion for software development, I also want what I put out there to be useful to somebody (maybe even somebodies). If I can solve a problem, that means another developer doesn't have to. Everybody wins and it's good karma.
* **Get better.** I know some things, but I don't know a lot of things. Aside from the personal and technical growth that will come from the process of preparing my words and bits for all to see, I love collaborating with and learning from people who know more than I do.
* **Avoid TL;DR.** No matter how interesting a post is, it's frustrating to read for 10 minutes, only to realize you still have over half-way to go. I pledge to blow your mind, but keep it quick (this post excluded).

I hope you read and enjoy what is to come and I encourage your feedback!

#### A Little About Me

I've been a software developer for 9 years, doing web development for most of that time. For a number of years I worked on an application using ASP.NET, C#, and SQL Server. Since the emergence of JavaScript in recent years, I've done a lot more work on that front, especially with [jQuery](http://jquery.com) (obvious, right?), [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com), and even [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/). There are many more frameworks and libraries that are interesting to me but for which I have yet to scratch the surface, so I'm excited to use this blog as a venue for those adventures.
